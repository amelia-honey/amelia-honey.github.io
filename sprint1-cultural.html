      <p class="main-text">Hi, I’m Amelia Honey. People call me Amy. I’ve grown up in Wellington my whole life and have many insights into pedestrian access ways. I began working in early childhood education (ECE) in 2012 after leaving high school and gained experience in a range of centres and contexts over the next nine years. I gained my Bachelor of Teaching (ECE) at the end of 2019.</p>
      <p class="main-text">My work in ECE pushed me to think about ethics every day. I was never in a ‘decision-making role’ as such, but my job involved making countless small decisions moment to moment. Grounding these decisions in ethics, principles and theories is at the heart of good teaching practice. Ethical decision making, in the context of ECE, are crucial to building trusting professional relationships, a nurturing learning environment and ensuring the best learning outcomes. A lot of the values that resonate with my philosophy of education carry through into other contexts as well. At the core of this is respect and individuation. I believe all people have the right to be seen and valued, and to exist in contexts that affirm and nurture who we are. ECE is a deeply relational profession. I’ve come to see most things through this relational lens. Listening and understanding are crucial tools in shaping contexts and systems to be human-centred and fit for their purpose.</p>
      <p class="main-text">According to CliftonStrengths, my top five strengths are: futuristic; connectedness; strategic; empathy and; analytical. While I don’t have 100% faith in psychometric testing, I do think these themes reflect some important stuff about who I am and are a good spring-board to begin a conversation about that. I only paid for the budget version of this test, which was still way too expensive by the way, and as such don’t have access to the extensive write-ups about what the strengths ‘mean’. But for me the value of these tools lies less in the information they deliver and more in being a prompt for self reflection and creating a space for people to tell their own truth about who they are. So, I’m futuristic. Hell yeah, baby, I am only trying to live my life long enough to be meld with or be obliterated by the singularity. I’m at a point of change in my life right now, and I’m committed to making the future a better place for me and others. Connectedness. I like to think about how things fit together. I like to think about how people fit together. I like to think about where peoples ideas and values sit in relation to mine and cultural contexts or experiences. I like patterns, systems, and narratives. Strategic. I’m solutions focused and enjoy creating a plan to word toward a desired outcome. I enjoy understanding what resources and options are available, what their limitations are and how to best implement and work around them. Empathy. I can sense how people are feeling and enjoy trying to understand the nuances of their feelings, thoughts and experiences. Analytical. Like I said, I do love a pattern. I think a lot. Most of it is noise. But if I’m interested in something I really appreciate gaining more understanding about it and seeing it from new angles.</p>
      <p class="main-text">I think I’m well equipped to follow this path of learning. It’s certainly a challenge, but a manageable one that has already taught me some wonderful things. I’m deeply enjoying learning about tech, and I think the strengths I bring with me help my engagement with it. While I enjoy collaboration, I expect to be challenged by these aspects of work. CliftonStrengths categorises my five themes as either ‘strategic thinking’ or ‘relationship building’. There are two other categories, which are ‘executing’ and ‘influencing’, and no themes in these categories appeared in my top five. How does that resonate with me? I benefit a lot from someone who can take the lead. I enjoy working with and supporting that person more than being them, as it just doesn’t come naturally to me. Depending on the group dynamic, my deferential attitude can hinder progress. That one potential learning obstacle that I’m keeping an eye out for and hope can challenge me to take a more active part in putting my voice into collaborative situations. In the past that has been a barrier to working productively with others. Tensions can arise when people sense I have something to say but am holding it back, it can be uncomfortable for myself and them, and that’s something I would like to try and avoid. I think speaking my mind is a really important way to ensure a productive group dynamic. It might sound silly if you already do that easily, but I’ve seen what happens when one group member (me) is acting like a ghost. The work is actively shaping the ideas and plan, not just doing the tasks that come out of planning. As I continue to gain clarity into my thoughts and feelings, I find it increasingly doable to simply speak my mind and find that people appreciate my input more than I expect them to. I find that people would rather work with an active participant who may be wrong sometimes than someone who does not contribute for fear of judgement. My strategy is to simply be myself. Which is easier said than done, but I believe I’m on the right path.</p>
