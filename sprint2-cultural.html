    My long term career pathway is to have an interesting job with competent, inspiring people to learn from. I want a job that’s flexible around me and allows for some autonomy around who I engage with and how I structure my life. I want to do work that is meaningful in some way, be it related to education or something else that contributes to the quality of human experience (both the experience of a really well designed, well made, user-friendly website and macro level quality of life things). The skills I’d like to grow are: confidently speaking out in team discussion dynamics, because sometimes in the past I’ve known what I wanted to contribute to a situation but held myself back from doing it and; to take critical feedback without getting all up in my head about it, remembering that it’s ok to hear what you could improve outlined by someone else and it’s ok to have made mistakes. The important thing is to take things on board but move on and build on that critique. My strengths are that I am an analytical, strategic thinker and enjoy figuring out problems and planning and implementing solutions. I am dedicated to doing the best quality work I can, and I’m a good listener.

    Time management is important, and managing the space I’m in as well. My goals for time management are to develop more consistent routine around when I get up and start working each day (that really helps me get into a motivated mindset), and to read all the tasks for the entire week so I have an overview of what’s happening and won’t get behind because I focused too heavily on some things early in the week and neglected others. Allowing a heavy workload to accumulate towards the end of the week is stressful and not something I particularly enjoy. On top of this I find myself feeling more focused and productive when I work in the right kind of environment, for example the library. I am aiming to spend 3-4 days a week working at the library to ensure there are times where I can solidly commit to my work and my work only without people asking me if I want to have a quick look at their progress in a video game or whatever. I currently have very few other scheduling commitments that I need to plan around. There are a few appointments coming up which are an hour long in the morning. There will be one morning during foundations when I can attend that on my way to the library, and I will be about an hour late to the second day of bootcamp. I have made sure that I won’t have appointments for the rest of bootcamp after that.

    Seeking help in a timely way is important, and can be difficult sometimes. I find it easy to feel embarrassed about asking for help and that can be a barrier to getting the right support. My weekly checkin with my facilitator is an open space to ask for help and it’s important for me to be honest about where I am at and where I might be struggling. The meeting is right in the middle of the week so I have a few days to work through things and get a feel for the content and learning objectives of the week, and identify things that are feeling difficult. Seeking advice from my facilitator during this time allows me a good chance to implement any feedback or advice over the remaining time in the week and get things finalised and polished. I want to manage work with other students in a similar way, to be honest and clear about where I’m at and hopefully act in a way that allows others the space to feel they can do that too. I can also seek emotional support from the friends I live with well, as well as a bit of technical help from one of them in certain areas. I expect the facilitator team to want to see me succeed, and to be keen to help answer my questions or help me find strategies to seek out that information.
