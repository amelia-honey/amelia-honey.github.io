        <h3 class="heading">EQ and IQ</h3>
        <p class="main-text">Emotional presence and intelligence quotient (IQ). The yin and yang of being a successful person. Ugh… If your experience is anything like mine, you knew about IQ for a long time. I heard about it early on in primary school. Intelligence. The be all and end all of a person’s mental worth, and prospects in life. For a long time that was the predominant focus of institutionalised education. A cynical and reductive account of what makes a person worthwhile, and what they might contribute to their own life and the wider world. It wasn’t until I reached adolescence that I actually heard the term EQ. Of course people had talked about social skills to me, including in my schooling, but the undertone was very much that it was nice and good and all very well, but really you ought to be intelligent above all else, especially in the educational context. And of course it was assumed that there was a perfect correlation between succeeding in the educational system and out there in the ‘real world’ (or as we called it back then: ‘university’ - lmao).</p>
        <p class="main-text">Now, don’t get me wrong. Intelligence is beautiful. Pattern recognition and analysis, forming logical trains of thought, academic knowledge are all things I really respect. But in the late 90s and early 2000s, when I was in primary school, the discourse around intelligence was incredibly limited. It remained like this throughout my time in high school as well. The term IQ was used a lot, and the focus was on retaining content knowledge - recalling facts, remembering things. There wasn’t even a lot of talk about the ways of thinking that made a person “intelligent”, there were just smarties and cabbages, end of. These were my formative discussions of what it meant to be ‘smart’ and to have value in society. I don’t think I’m alone in having internalised a narrow view of what it meant to have value during childhood and adolescence, and carrying that with me for a long time afterwards. </p>
        <p class="main-text">It bears mentioning that the Intellectual Quotient (IQ) tests used to measure intelligence are designed to recognise a very specific type of thinking. It’s about logic, reasoning, and pattern recognition. It helps to have a good memory. IQ tests privilege certain way of thinking and knowing, and have been shown to be systemically racist from their design to how they’re implemented in developing and maintaining status quo within educational and societal institutions. So while I recognise intellect as a wonderful quality, I really couldn’t care less about the number someone attributes to their intellectual ability. Intellect is a quality, emotional skills are quality. They’re both very useful ways of engaging with the world. Because I view these as distinct (but connected) ways of perceiving, I tend to avoid the term ‘emotional intelligence’. I feel that the term was useful in giving value to emotional skills in the context intelligence being so heavily favoured, but it doesn’t really sound quite right to me based on my current working definitions. </p>
        <p class="main-text">My working definition of intelligence hasn’t changed much since childhood besides becoming a bit more nuanced in the ways of thinking it refers to. My idea of what it means to be skilled and successful, on the other hand, has changed a great deal. The value I place on intelligence has dwindled and I now see it as one of many skills a person might possess. Educational discourse has evolved along similar lines, and a lot of my understanding of how the qualities of intellect and emotions fit together in a person comes from an education, specifically early-childhood, lens. A core focus of assessment practice in early-childhood education is ‘learning dispositions.’ Learning dispositions are, more or less, an assessment of emotional skills. This lens recognises that the ways a person responds to and approaches situations, problem solving and, the emotions of themselves and others is more important to their learning journey than what specific things they know. Emotional capacities such as self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy and perseverance are super important because possessing these can translate well into any scenario, and form the context in which intelligence and content knowledge can be cultivated. Facts come and go, we learn and forget things, we have to adapt working theories on the regular - and that can be uncomfortable! The emotional capacity to deal with changes is important to keeping your intelligence relevant. Emotional skills help us form helpful relationships in learning and working contexts. Keeping up a good relationship with yourself is always going to be important, and keeping up good relationships with others is important almost as much of the time. </p>
        <p class="main-text">Thanks for reading this rambling post. And please don’t think I’m shitting on intelligence in general. Intelligent people are hot, and I respect you. Reflecting on my past experiences hits a nerve sometimes as I feel the systemic focus on a narrow idea of intelligence was just not all that useful or truthful. I grapple with self-esteem about both my intellectual and emotional capacities most days, and that’s one of the reasons I’m passionate about shifting the focus of education to be more encompassing of the rich array of human experiences and ways of knowing, being, and doing. If you read this far, I’m wishing you the best on your own learning journey throughout life, and I hope you appreciate yourself.</p>
