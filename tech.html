    <h3 class="heading red-text">Classes and IDs</h3>
      <p>CSS is used to add style to your HTML stuff. In CSS you can apply changes to fonts, colours, margins, sizes, etc. The list goes on, you can style each and every element how you like. But how does CSS know which elements should be styled a certain way? That’s where classes and IDs come in. Classes and IDs are known as ‘selectors’ because they help CSS select elements to add styles to. There are other types of selectors as well, but class and ID are very common and very useful, and this post is only about them.</p>
      <p>Classes and IDs allow you to be more specific than simply styling all elements of a certain type. Without using a selector, you could style all the text-block elements by telling CSS to look for the paragraph tag used to create those text elements.</p>

      <p>Above is a screenshot showing the styling for all paragraph elements. All the elements created with the paragraph tag will be styled like this unless they have a class that adds something different.</p>
      <p class="red-text">Using the class selector gives you a few more options. It allows you to choose certain paragraphs to be a certain way, but leave others as they were. So if you want one paragraph, such as this one, to be coloured you could do that with a class. This paragraph has the “red-text” class, so the color will apply to it but not the paragraphs with no class. By adding the class to other paragraphs you could turn more of them red.

      <p class="red-text">Above is a screenshot of the red-text class in CSS which will change any text elements to this colour.</p>

      <p>Above are screenshots of the HTML. The first shows a paragraph without a class while the other has the red-text. The first one takes on the generic styling for paragraphs and the one with the red-text class also becomes red.</p>
      <p>Something cool about classes is you can use them for different kinds of elements. For example, the title of this post is made with an h3 (heading) tag, but also shares the red-text class, so it will be styled according to that along with the paragraphs of that class. Classes can apply to multiple elements of multiple types. In the case of this post's tite, it has both the classes "heading" and "red-text". See the screenshot below.</p>
