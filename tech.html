    <h3 class="heading">Classes and IDs</h3>
      <p>CSS is used to add style to your HTML stuff. In CSS you can apply changes to fonts, colours, margins, sizes, etc. The list goes on, you can style each and every element how you like. But how does CSS know which elements should be styled a certain way? That’s where classes and IDs come in. Classes and IDs are known as ‘selectors’ because they help CSS select elements to add styles to. There are other types of selectors as well, but class and ID are very common and very useful, and this post is only about them.</p>
      <p>Classes and IDs allow you to be more specific than simply styling all elements of a certain type. Without using a selector, you could style all the text-block elements by telling CSS to look for the paragraph tag used to create those text elements.</p>

      <p>Here is my CSS styling for generic text (above). All the elements created with the paragraph tag will be styled like this.</p>
      <p class="red-text">Using the class selector gives you a few more options. It allows you to choose certain paragraphs to be a certain way, but leave others as they were. So if you want one paragraph, such as this one, to be coloured you could do that with a class. Only this paragraph has the “red-text” class, so the styling will only apply to it and not the other paragraphs. By adding the class to other paragraphs you could turn more of them red.
