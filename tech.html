    <h3 class="heading red-text">Classes and IDs</h3>
      <p class="main-text">CSS is used to add style to your HTML stuff. In CSS you can apply changes to fonts, colours, margins, sizes, etc. The list goes on, you can style each and every element how you like. But how does CSS know which elements should be styled a certain way? That’s where classes and IDs come in. Classes and IDs are known as ‘selectors’ because they help CSS select elements to add styles to. There are other types of selectors as well, but class and ID are very common and very useful, and this post is only about them.</p>
      <p class="main-text">Classes and IDs allow you to be more specific than simply styling all elements of a certain type. Without using a selector, you could style all the text-block elements by telling CSS to look for the paragraph tag used to create those text elements.</p>
      <img class="screenshot" src="https://i.ibb.co/9Vp4LnG/p-style.png" alt="CSS-selecting-all-paragraph-elements">
      <p class="main-text">Above is a screenshot showing the styling for all paragraph elements. All the elements created with the paragraph tag will be styled like this unless they have a class that adds something different.</p>
      <p class="main-text red-text">Using the class selector gives you a few more options. It allows you to choose certain paragraphs to be a certain way, but leave others as they were. So if you want one paragraph, such as this one, to be coloured you could do that with a class. This paragraph has the “red-text” class, so the color will apply to it but not the paragraphs with no class. By adding the class to other paragraphs you could turn more of them red.

      <p class="main-text red-text">Above is a screenshot of the red-text class in CSS which will change any text elements to this colour.</p>

      <p class="main-text">Above are screenshots of the HTML. The first shows a paragraph without a class while the other has the red-text. The first one takes on the generic styling for paragraphs and the one with the red-text class also becomes red.</p>
      <p class="main-text">Something cool about classes is you can use them for different kinds of elements. For example, the title of this post is made with an h3 (heading) tag and has the red-text class, so it will be coloured red just like the paragraphs of that class. Classes can apply to multiple elements of multiple types. In the case of this post's tite, it has both the classes "heading" and "red-text". See the screenshot below.</p>

      <p class="main-text">The above screenshot shows that a single element can have more than one class. It's a bit confusing that I gave the class the same name as the element, sorry about that. But all the headings across this blog are styled by the heading class. The heading for this post in particular has the additional class "red-text". See below for how this was done in CSS.</p>
      <img class="screenshot" src="https://i.ibb.co/StwGP7p/multiple-classes.png" alt="CSS-classes-for-heading-and-red-text">
      <p class="main-text">The above screenshot shows two CSS classes, "heading" and "red-text". It's a bit confusing that I named the class heading when that is also the name of the a type of element, sorry about that. But that class is applied to all the headings on this dinky little website. It dictates the font, size, margins, padding, colour and alignment. Because the title of this post in particular has the extra class for red-text, it looks a little bit different. What's going on there? When CSS sees multiple classes is will apply both where it can. For things that don't contradict each other it will do both, for example if one class was changing margins and the other one was changing colour. But in this case they do contradict each other. There are two colours being specified by the different classes. When there is a contradiction like this CSS will prioritise whatever is placed lower down in the CSS file.</p>
      <p class="main-text">Now that we've gone over classes, let's talk about IDs. IDs are similar to classes in that by giving one to an HTML element will tell CSS how to style that element. But there's a really important difference: IDs are unique to a specific element. Only one element can have an ID and that's it. So giving things an ID is best for when they're a unique feature of a page. While classes can group lots of elements together, IDs set them apart. Using an ID to dictate CSS styling is helpful when you want to make something special, for example the beautiful photograph on the home page of this website. It's got it's own ID because it's one of a kind, whereas the screenshots used in this post all have the same class. IDs are one-offs for a reason. They can be used not just for styling, but also identifying an element for a link to lead to. Here's an example:</p>
